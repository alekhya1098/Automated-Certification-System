An Android-based application developed to automate the college certificate issuing process.  
This system allows students to apply for certificates online and enables administrators to approve or reject requests efficiently, reducing manual effort and improving transparency.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

In traditional college systems, students must physically visit the institution to apply for certificates (such as Bonafide, ID Card, Bus Pass, or Marks Memo) and check their due clearances.  
The **Automated Certification System** replaces this manual process with an online platform that enables:

- Students to apply for certificates remotely.  
- Administrators to verify requests and send updates via email notifications.  
- Streamlined tracking of application status, reducing time and paperwork.

---

## 🧩 Features

### 👨‍🎓 Student Module
- Register and log in securely.
- Apply online for certificates (Bonafide, Memo, ID Card, Bus Pass).
- View application status updates in real time.

### 🧑‍💼 Admin Module
- Approve or reject student registrations.
- View and manage certificate requests.
- Notify students of approval via email.
- Maintain branch-wise student data.
